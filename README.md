mini project - app deployment into EKS along with Ingress 
EKS Pros:
Managed Control Plane: In EKS, cloud provider AWS itself takes care of managing the Kubernetes control plane components, such as the API server, controller manager, and etcd. AWS handles upgrades, patches, and ensures high availability of the control plane, so we donâ€™t need to bother about it. 

Automated Updates: EKS automatically updates the Kubernetes version, eliminating the need for manual intervention and ensuring that the cluster stays up-to-date with the latest features and security patches.

Scalability: EKS can automatically scale the Kubernetes control plane based on demand, ensuring the cluster remains responsive as the workload increases.

AWS Integration: EKS seamlessly integrates with various AWS services, such as AWS IAM for authentication and authorization, Amazon VPC for networking, and AWS Load Balancers for service exposure.

Monitoring and Logging: EKS integrates with AWS CloudWatch for monitoring cluster health and performance metrics, making it easier to track and troubleshoot issues.
